## Computer Science Labs

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, Part 1 was one of my favorite labs to do. I liked this one because I've always wondered how lights
    in my keyboard worked. The satisfaction I got when I saw the animated image that I had created was like no 
    other. The way that you can change the way colors move through an image is such an amazing concept.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, Part 1 was another of my favorites just because sandwiches are one of my favorite foods. This code 
    was very interesting to me because it was just so simple in the way that it just typed out your sandwich
    order. It also peaked my interest since this might be a type of code that fast food restaurants use at the
    register to take your order.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was also one of my favorites since it was the first code I had ever written. It was also the first one I 
    had struggled so, the accomplishment I felt when I saw that it had compiled felt great. When I saw the words    
    Hello World on my screen felt so unreal that I couldn't believe I had just coded that myself.
